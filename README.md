## Code Review
- CSS Framework: [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I think Tailwind is really interesting, I have seen people use it on youtube, although it is very far from vanilla css, I can see how this can be useful for companies who wants to create custom presets for their developers in order to make sure that the design and style will not go wrong.
