## Code Review
- CSS Framework: [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I think Tailwind is really interesting, I have seen people use it on youtube, although it is very far from vanilla css, I can see how this can be useful for companies who wants to create custom presets for their developers in order to make sure that the design and style will not go wrong. 

### Problems

- Although I enjoy this framework, I believe there's much more to learn, I'm having a hard time understanding how to use the **tailwind.config.js**: module exports. I believe there's a much better way to do this page than how I do it.
- Also had problems, importing fonts. I tried to follow people's advise from stackoverflow and tailwindcss itself, but it does not work.
- layout optimization, I could not get my content to align properly when I go to mobile view.
